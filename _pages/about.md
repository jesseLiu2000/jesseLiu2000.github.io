Hi! I am Zijie, a master student at Washington University in St. Louis, majoring in computer science. In my first year, I was RA in the WashU NLP group, advised by Prof. Chenguang. Now, I work with Prof. William and Prof. CJ on my Master Project.

My research interests include Multimodel Fusion, Multi-Arm Bandits and AI for healthcare.

I have tried several projects related to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing during my undergraduate and graduate years. Currently, I mainly work on the explainability of large models through different methods.



I will be applying for a PhD in 2024.

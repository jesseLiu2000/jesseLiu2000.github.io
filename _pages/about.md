Hi! I am Zijie, a master's student in McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, majoring in computer science, and I am also a member of WashU NLP group advised by Prof. Chenguang Wang.

I have gained my BS degree in 2022.

My research interest includes Multimodel Fusion, Sentimental Analysis (mainly Sarcasm Detection) and Structural Prediction.

I have done some projects about NLU during my undergraduate period, and I build a Multimodel to detect sarcasm for my undergraduate thesis, I have published it on my Github, and I will continue to update my code until it attains an expected result. Recently, I arrange some projects covering fundamental CV and NLU, which I have done in my undergraduate period, and then I will upload them on my Github. If there are any problems with my code, feel free to email me at any time.

Now, I want to explore meta Learning and zero-shot Learning, I want to try different methods to optimize my sarcasm detection model, so if you have any interests in those aspects, feel free to contact me!

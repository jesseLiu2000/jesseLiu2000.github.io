Hi! I am Zijie, a master's student in McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, majoring in computer science, and I am also a member of WashU NLP group advised by Prof. Chenguang Wang.

<!-- I have gained my BS degree in 2022. -->

My research interest includes Multimodel Fusion, Sentimental Analysis (mainly Sarcasm Detection) and Structural Prediction.

I have done some projects about NLU during my undergraduate period. Recently, I arrange some projects covering fundamental CV and NLU, which I have done in my undergraduate period, and then I have upload them on my Github. 

Now, I want to explore meta Learning and zero-shot Learning and I plan to apply for my PhD in 2024.

Hi! I am Zijie, a master student in Washington University in St. Louis, majoring in computer science, and I am also a member of WashU NLP group advised by Prof. Chenguang Wang.

<!-- I have gained my BS degree in 2022. -->

My research interest includes Multimodel Fusion, Sentimental Analysis (mainly Sarcasm Detection) and Prompt Learning.

I have done some projects about NLU during my undergraduate period, and I build a multi-layer fusion model based on attention mechanism for my undergraudate thesis. I have arranged some projects covering fundamental CV and NLU, which I have done in my undergraduate period, and then I have push them on my Github. 

Recently, I update some NLP foundamental programs on my github, mainly arrounding how to use the basic NN (RNN/LSTM..) to finish the simple language task.

I will pursuit my PhD degree in 2024.
